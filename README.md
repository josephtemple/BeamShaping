[WIP]

Hello! This project is in fulfillment of the Undergraduate Research required for physics majors at Arkansas Tech University, performed under the advisorship of Dr. Jessica Young. This description will become more thorough as more things happen, but in short the goal is to leverage machine learning techniques for the calibration of a spatial light modulator (SLM), and perhaps correct for non-Gaussian-ness in the initial beam. Time will tell!

Note: To ensure correct package dependencies, create a new Python environment and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
